- 👋 Hi, I’m Sirisha
- I'm passionate about Machine Learnng, Data Science, Large Language Models(LLMs) and Generative AI.
  The rapid rate at which there is advancement in computing power and the freedom to take a large volumne of data pushes the field of Artificial Intelligence to a whole new level
  👨‍🎓🙋‍♂️ About Me 💼🎒:
I hold a Masters Degree in MSIS Majors in (Data Science) at California State University Los Angeles



Furthermore, I have a strong practical and theoretical experience in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI.


🔭 I've used different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in real-time projects. Below are some used models:

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Trees (DT)
Random Forests (RF)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Deep Neural Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Naive Bayes (NB)
Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)
XGBoost
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
🔭 Below are some state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series forecasting models used in various real-time projects:

Auto-Regressive (AR) Model
Auto-Regressive Moving Averages (ARMA) Model
Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) Model
Neural Hierarchical Interpolation of Time Series (N-HiTS) Model
Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (SARIMA) Model
🔭 Furthermore, below are some of the tools used during my experience for Generative AI:

Langchain
LangGraph
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
Llama Index
OpenAI API
Mixtral (LLM)
Llama 2 (LLM)
GPT - 3 (LLM)
GPT - 3.5 (LLM)
GPT - 4 (LLM)
🔭 Here are some of the skillsets in regards to DevOps technologies:

Docker
Docker-Compose
Kubernetes
Linux
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
Travis CI
Ubuntu
GitLab CI/CD
